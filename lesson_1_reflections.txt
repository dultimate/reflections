Before the the commit was made the worked fine.
But after the change that was made some bug was introduced and it crashed the game.
Using diff -u filename1 filename2 command helped me see what exactly has changed in the two files and where ?
So this was very helpful in setting the code correct back to normalcy !


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

On having easy access to the entire history , we can see what changes have been made to reach a certain point !
We can also see and keep track of our frequent errors and make them less frequent !
It also helps in collaborwating with other people.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

When we have the control in our hands it's more often than not is better !
We can work in our own pace without having to wory about the automatic save feature of the system.
Automated process restrict our pace!
It may not necessarily save the finished changes and this might be very troublesome!
Make one commit per logical change!
