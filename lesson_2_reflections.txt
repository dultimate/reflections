What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans ::- 
		When we initialize a repository a .git directory is introduced in the directory.
		To check this you need to do a ls -a and not just ls

		We need to do this because .git directory is the thing that differentiates between a normal directory and a git repository.
